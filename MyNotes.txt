New installs:

Seed Member and User DBs
E.g.
  localhost:4000/seed/install

Or

Register Member via program interface.

Then use Mongo.exe command line interface to initially set Member to Local Administrator.

E.g.
  db.triage.update( { “email” : ”easy1@easy.com” } , { $set : {membership_role :
  “Local Administrator” }})

Uncomment layout.pug line #33 to initially seed admin DB.
